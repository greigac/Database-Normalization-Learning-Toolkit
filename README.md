# Dissertation Project
### Database Normalization Learning Toolkit

This was the project I created for my Dissertation: Database Normalization Learning Toolkit (Finding out why users struggle with normalization). It has been a few years now since this was created and I felt the time was right to make it Open Source. It is the first of its kind to be browser based using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON.

The scope and objectives for the project were as follows:
  * Identify the specific objectives of the study + take research gathered and create a toolkit based on it.
  * This includes the key points of Database Normalization that users are struggling on.
  * Create and test different tutorials based on the research gathered. Research being user data. 
  * Consistently apply updates to the toolkit until a solution was found.

### Deployment 

Simply pull the data and upload to either a localhost or server. No database required as data is stored with JSON.

### Results and changes

Now that the toolkit is open source:
  * The solution to what key points of Database Normalization that users struggle on still needs more research.
  * The toolkit needs to be altered to aim towards more of the area that users struggle on. Right now it is a 
    interactive tool that helps you along each step, but does not solve the solution as to why they struggle. 

It has been a while now since this was created and at the time I found that little research was done on the topic and little to no solutions were found. Wether Normalization really is still a problem, or ever was is still to be found.
